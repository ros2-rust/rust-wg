## [rclrs](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust)

- CI is currently missing
  - @esteve has started a draft to restore CI for ROS2 Foxy
  - update repo from azure pipelines to github actions
  - help and suggestions welcome!
  - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/pull/29

  - Like point clouds or laser scans
  - Current blocker is missing support for IDL arrays
  - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/27
  - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/21
- Missing tests
  - could use some more unit and system tests
  - particularly performance benchmarks for vetting future PRs
  - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/33
- Message generation
  - Heavily dependent on ament cmake macros, and python template expansion
    - could either extend ament support for rust
    - or improve cmake integration, e.g. with corrosion
    - https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion
    - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/32
  - Exploring alternatives, like upstreaming Message generation
    - packing and distributing rust support for common messages
    - rust doesn't yet support sharked linking
    - https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html
    - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/11
- Improve support for rust language analyzers
  - rust-analyzer gets confused by auto generated messages
  - message types remain recognized, imparting user IDE support
  - https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust/issues/34
- Resources for leaning more about ROS2 architecture
  - Design Docs
    - https://design.ros2.org/
  - Core Stack Developer Overview
    - http://docs.ros2.org/latest/developer_overview.html

## Other items

- Communication channel for synchros chat
  - Matrix community and rooms for ROS Rust WG are now public
  - [`+rosorg-rust:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/+rosorg-rust:matrix.org)
  - Note: be sure to join both the matrix community and rooms their in
  - The matrix community only has one room at the moment, but more can be added as needed
  - Good for keeping tabs between WG member or informal simple rust + ros Q/A
  - But avoid splintering technical decision discussions by keeping them to repo tickets

## Action items

- colcon-cargo
  - Dedicate future WG meeting entirely to this
  - integration with ament index and filesystem
  - support for pure rust ros packages that are creates
  - applicable for downstream users of rclrs
